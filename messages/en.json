  "Who_We_Are_Description": "Khitat Al-Ihsan was born from Al-Ihsan Mother Association and launched with sincere support from Lebanese expatriates in Australia, who united under one cause believing that solidarity makes a difference. As the crises in Lebanon worsened, with rising living costs and the absence of the state, expatriates responded with responsibility and compassion.\n\nKhitat Al-Ihsan Charity Social Association was founded in 2018 in Tripoli, Lebanon, carrying a humanitarian mission to stand with those most in need and to serve them with dignity, compassion, and integrity. Independent of any political affiliation, we believe that humanitarian work is not just charity, but a responsibility rooted in our shared humanity.\n\nFrom this reality, Khitat Al-Ihsan emerged as a humanitarian response aimed at securing basic living needs, from supporting education and healthcare to standing beside orphans and underprivileged families, to be a hand of giving and hope in times of hardship.",
